# v1.6.0 Release Notes (2025-06-23)

## Overview
Version 1.6.0 is a significant release that completes the LGTM (Loki, Grafana, Tempo, Mimir) observability stack implementation and enhances the load testing capabilities. This release consolidates the previously planned v1.5.1 and v1.5.2 releases into a single comprehensive update.

## Observability Enhancements
- **Complete LGTM Stack:** Added Grafana Mimir for long-term metrics storage, completing the LGTM observability stack.
- **Enhanced Metrics Storage:** Configured Prometheus remote write to Mimir for durable metrics retention.
- **Grafana Integration:** Added auto-provisioned Mimir data source to Grafana.
- **Unified Observability:** Dashboard improvements to show metrics, logs, and traces in one place.

## Load Testing Improvements
- **Improved Load Testing:** Fixed k6 test script validation for task status values, ensuring all tests run successfully in local and CI environments.
- **Docker Integration:** Enhanced k6 test execution with proper Docker support, fixed path references, and consistent volume mounts.
- **CI Workflow:** Updated GitHub Actions workflow for reliable k6 test execution and results collection.
- **API Compatibility:** Ensured all test scripts use API-valid status values (`todo`, `inProgress`, `blocked`, `done`).

## Technical Details

### Mimir Integration
- Added Mimir service to docker-compose.yml
- Created mimir-config.yml with appropriate settings

- Updated Prometheus configuration for remote write to Mimir
- Added Mimir data source to Grafana provisioning

### Load Testing Fixes
- Updated k6 test scripts to use only API-valid status values
- Fixed path references for Docker integration
- Enhanced Docker Compose configuration for k6
- Improved CI workflow for k6 test execution

## Documentation Updates
- Completely rewrote README.md to focus on the LGTM stack
- Added comprehensive observability guide
- Created new documentation files:
  - MIMIR_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md
  - K6_STATUS_VALIDATION_FIX_COMPLETE.md
  - K6_LOAD_TESTING_DOCUMENTATION.md

## Future Work
- Enhancing Mimir retention policies and configuration
- Creating more advanced observability dashboards
- Improving trace sampling configuration
- Adding more business metrics to the observability stack
